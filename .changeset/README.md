# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the readme](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/README.md)

**What is a changeset?** A changeset is a piece of information about changes made to packages in a
monorepo. It contains a summary of the changes and the type of version bump (major, minor, patch).

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new changeset
bunx changeset

# Apply changesets to bump versions and update changelogs
bunx changeset version

# Publish changed packages to npm
bunx changeset publish
```
